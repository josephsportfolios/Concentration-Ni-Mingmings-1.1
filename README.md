## Progarm Structure
The main program that runs the game is located at [Game1.cs](https://github.com/josephsportfolios/Concentration-Ni-Mingmings-Code-Base/blob/master/Game1.cs). We are using Monogame and C# as our main framework for our game. We also used these particular frameworks in order to incorporate more complex graphics within our application.<br />
To run our program from a console, you need to have the Monogame framework and the Visual Studio 2019 version, as Monogame is yet to support Visual Studio 2022.
